## Usage

The module includes three main components:

    include riemann
    include riemann::dash
    include riemann::tools

Riemann represents the Riemann daemon and associated configuration,
riemann:dash the dashboard and riemann::tools the client and a couple of
daemons for pushing example data into Riemann.

## Configuration

The riemann class has some defaults that can be overridden, for
instance if you wanted a specific version of riemann:

    class { 'riemann': version => '0.1.1' }

More useful is probably the ability to override the default
configuration file.

    class { 'riemann': config_file => '/etc/riemann.config' }

In this last case you're responsible for making sure that file exists,
via another puppet resource or otherwise.

By default, this module will attempt to download the .bz2 archive from
aphyr.com, run by the author of Riemann. An alternative source can be
provided: 

	class { 'riemann': source => 'http://myserver.corp', path=> '/riemann/' }
